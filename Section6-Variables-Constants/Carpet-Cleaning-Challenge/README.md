# Section 6: Variables and Constants Challenge  
*Carpet Cleaning Service Calculator*  

## 🎯 Goal  
Practice using variables and constants in C++ to calculate service costs.

## 📝 Code Features
- Uses `const` for prices, tax rate, and expiry days
- Takes user input for room quantities
- Calculates and displays costs with tax

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
g++ section6_carpet_cleaning.cpp -o program
./program
## 📸 Sample Output  
```
